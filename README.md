# Quantum Transduction and Lossy Channel Simulator

This repository contains a **Python simulator** built with the [QuTiP library](http://qutip.org/) for modeling quantum communication systems that involve:

- **Imperfect entangled photon sources**  
- **Lossy optical fiber channels**  
- **Noisy electro-optic (optical-to-microwave) quantum transduction**

The simulator implements **Monte Carlo trajectory simulations** and **analytical models** for fidelity estimation in hybrid quantum communication chains. Two encoding models are supported:
- **Time-bin encoding (Model 1)**
- **Single-rail Fock state encoding (Model 2)**

It provides both **numerical simulations** and **closed-form analytical predictions**, allowing performance benchmarking under realistic noise and loss conditions.

## Overview

Quantum networks require efficient **photon transmission** over long distances and **transduction** between optical and microwave domains to interface with superconducting qubits.  

This simulator models a **hybrid chain** where:
- An **imperfect source** generates entangled photon-qubit states with a tunable fidelity.
- Photons propagate through a **lossy optical fiber channel** (exponential attenuation with distance).
- Photons undergo **noisy electro-optic transduction** to the microwave regime, subject to thermal noise.  

The simulator evaluates the **state fidelity** between the final quantum state and the ideal entangled state under these imperfections.
